  mobDescription: "Goblins are sneaky, explosive-loving menaces with a talent for
    causing chaos (often at their own expense). Clumped in clans under a War Chieftain\u2014or
    a particularly reckless Warlord\u2014they fight dirty, loot everything, and cackle
    in their strange, squeaky language. Take one out, and the rest will be back soon\u2014louder,
    angrier, and probably on fire."
